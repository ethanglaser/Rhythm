# Spotify Player

This code is based on a framework that allows for various functionality related to Spotify's Android SDK in Kotlin, in the repository [here](https://github.com/tolkiana/spotify-player). The framework is utilized to re-implement the functionality from the [spotifyexploration](https://github.com/ethanglaser/Rhythm/blob/spotifyexploration/tempo.py) branch of this repository.

The SDK does not include GET requests for playlist or song information, so playlist information is currently hardcoded as JSON into a variable in the code. Either this functionality will need to be implemented or set playlists will be defined without the ability for a user to play their own.

An emulator with the Spotify App installed will be needed to run the code.
